##The Requirement

The very capable and talented engineering team at Stuworx had taken the core idea about the platform, ample inspiration from similar services around the web, and the most prominent and popular Design Language around - Material Design, and come up with a UI that didn’t necessarily address the requirements at hand, and wasn’t too aesthetically appealing either. The founders worried this wouldn’t go far in making a serious first impression with the target demographic; and even if it did, the students wouldn’t come back. 

I was asked to help the team redesign the overall product design and user-experience while still utilising Material Design principles, considering the team had, and continues to use, [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) as their frontend-framework of choice. 



##The Process

Aware that the effort wouldn't just be towards the comprehesive redesign, but also the heavy introspection from the team on their own decisions thus far, I opted for a sliglty different approach. I wanted the team to collectively brainstorm and come up with solutions themselves, with whatever guidance I could give. This would enable an honest review of thier own work but also give them greater assurance of the decisions being made for the way forward.

###Step 1 - Workshop
A couple of brainstorming sessions to help identify sample users and create Actor Maps and User Journeys. I really wanted the team to be confident of who their primary users were and how well they were approaching them through their interface. This process was to effectively understand what had to be done. As a part of this step, we also established the aspirations, visions and missions of the organisation. This would later help us in defining branding and content strategies, as well.

###Step 2 - Review 
This step was to help understand how their current interface stood up to what was required. A few ‘umms’ and ‘errs’ later, the team, by themselves, started making suggestions of how best to “move things around” to better suit their requirements. While these things seemed fairly obvious in hindsights, mashed up inspiration and clouded ideas tend to result in ineffective design decisions. 
The step also took into consideration data from the market and user research the team had already conducted. The data was there but didn’t really tell us a whole bunch, until we did more 
in-person surveys later and found more key aspects of consideration.

###Step 3 - Mockups
UX Designers often tend to go back to their notebooks or mockup tools at this stage. However, as a consultant, I wanted to work more closely with the engineering team and enable them on  not just better defining the user-flows, but also coming up with solutions to their requirements themselves. When I was confident that the team members understood the key areas of focus, I went to my mockup tool of choice - Sketch, and took a good week before I could come up with mockups for various screens. However, interestingly, the team which by now was well enthused with the redesign process, took to sketchbooks themselves and kept sharing their ideas with me.
